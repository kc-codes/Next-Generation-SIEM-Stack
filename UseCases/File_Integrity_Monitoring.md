# üõ°Ô∏è File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)

## üîç Overview
File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) ensures that **critical system files are protected from unauthorized modifications**. This module detects and alerts security teams whenever **files are changed, deleted, or accessed without authorization**, helping prevent cyber threats like malware infections, insider attacks, and unauthorized system modifications.

‚úÖ **Key Features:**
- Real-time monitoring of system directories.
- Custom detection rules for unauthorized modifications.
- Automatic alerts and incident response integration.
- Logging and forensic analysis for security auditing.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring File Integrity Monitoring in Wazuh
### **üîπ Step 1: Enable FIM Module**
1. Open the Wazuh configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
   ```
2. Add the following under `<localfile>` to monitor key system directories:
   ```xml
   <syscheck>
     <directories check_all="yes">/root,/etc,/var,/home</directories>
     <frequency>300</frequency>
     <alert_new_files>yes</alert_new_files>
   </syscheck>
   ```
3. Save the file and restart Wazuh:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
   ```

### **üîπ Step 2: Define Custom Detection Rules**
To trigger alerts for specific file modifications:
1. Open the Wazuh rules file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/ossec/rules/local_rules.xml
   ```
2. Add a custom rule for unauthorized changes:
   ```xml
   <group name="file_integrity_monitoring,"> 
     <rule id="100001" level="7"> 
       <decoded_as>syscheck</decoded_as>
       <match>Integrity checksum changed</match>
       <description>Unauthorized file modification detected</description>
     </rule> 
   </group>
   ```
3. Save the file and restart Wazuh:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
   ```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Validation
### **üîπ Step 1: Modify a Monitored File**
Run the following command to edit a monitored file:
```bash
sudo echo "Test modification" >> /etc/passwd
```

### **üîπ Step 2: Verify Alerts in Wazuh**
Check the Wazuh alerts log:
```bash
tail -f /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.json | jq '.'
```
Expected output:
```json
{
  "rule": {
    "id": "100001",
    "description": "Unauthorized file modification detected"
  },
  "location": "/etc/passwd",
  "alert_level": 7
}
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Incident Response & Mitigation
### **üîπ Step 1: Automate Response with Active Response**
1. Open Wazuh‚Äôs configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
   ```
2. Add an **active response** to isolate compromised endpoints:
   ```xml
   <command>
     <name>disable_host</name>
     <executable>firewalld</executable>
     <extra_args>-A INPUT -s $SOURCEIP -j DROP</extra_args>
   </command>
   ```
3. Save the file and restart Wazuh:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
   ```
