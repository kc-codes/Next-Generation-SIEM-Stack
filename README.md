# Next Generation SIEM Stack

## Overview
The **Next Generation SIEM Stack** is a robust security monitoring framework integrating **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** with advanced **log analysis, vulnerability assessment, and automated threat response** mechanisms. It combines **Wazuh, Suricata, OPNsense, and VirusTotal API** to provide comprehensive security monitoring across both network and endpoint layers.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **[File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)](UseCases/File_Integrity_Monitoring.md)** – Tracks unauthorized modifications to critical system files.
- **[Network Intrusion Detection (NIDS)](UseCases/Network_IDS_Suricata.md)** – Uses **Suricata IDS** to detect suspicious network activity.
- **[Vulnerability Assessment](UseCases/Vulnerability_Assessment.md)** – Scans systems for **known CVEs** and security weaknesses.
- **[Malicious Command Execution Detection](UseCases/Malicious_Command_Detection.md)** – Monitors commands for unauthorized system modifications.
- **[SSH Brute-Force Prevention](UseCases/SSH_Brute_Force_Prevention.md)** – Identifies and blocks repeated failed login attempts.
- **[VirusTotal API Integration](UseCases/Malicious_File_Detection.md)** – Detects and classifies malware-infected files.
- **[Security Awareness Module](Architecture.md#security-awareness-module)** – Provides 300+ best practices to improve personal security.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
This SIEM stack follows a **multi-layered defense model**, incorporating:
1. **[Firewall & IDS/IPS (OPNsense & Suricata)](Architecture.md#firewall-and-idsips-opnsense-suricata)** – Network-based monitoring and threat prevention.
2. **[Log Collection & Correlation (Wazuh SIEM)](Architecture.md#log-collection-and-correlation)** – Centralized event analysis and real-time alerting.
3. **[Security Awareness Module](Architecture.md#security-awareness-module)** – Ensuring cybersecurity hygiene through best practices.
4. **[Automated Incident Response](Architecture.md#automated-incident-response)** – Dynamic rules for blocking malicious IPs and files.
